advent of bad code

Hello, 

I'm not a coder, hence the name!
Mostly bash, sometimes I tried to a bit venture into python.

I was wondering if I should even share these horrors, but then I remembered that the company that owns GitHub once sold Windows Millenium.
At least my approach to solving the issues is my approach, you'll see what I mean!

The ones marked as issues solve the example but fail on the real dataset \o/
If by any chance you know how to fix one of those, please push and explain ^^.
